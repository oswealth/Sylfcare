# SYLFCARE
Your choice to a Better Mental Health


[Sylfcare](./index.html) is a web application that is designed to provide easy access to a psychologist without beig stigmatized by society.  
We believe everyone is unique and deserve to be happy. This is a platform where you can get access to therapists/psychologists who are driven by the mission of helping people live better and happier lives every day.

## The Story

At first, Sylfcare was envisioned as much different to what it is now.
It started as an idea for people to join group therapy, have video therapy sessions right from their comfort zone without anyone seeing them or stigmatizing them. A safe heaven platform where all your fears and worries can easily be meet, improving your overall Mental Health. However this idea was quickly changed because of the level difficulty it was for us as beginners and the limited time fram to submit our portfolio.
So faced with road blocks, we actually thought about what would be still a useful product. 
So brainstorming led to the insight that we could start by letting people know it was that easy to speak to a proffessional therapist or psychologist with the whole "neighbourhood finding out" - some form of easy access to daily mental health care.
Sylfcare attempts to increase the awareness of mental health care and making it accessible - for people to actually seek the help they need without worring about the stigmatization involved.

That is why we are called Sylfcare!
