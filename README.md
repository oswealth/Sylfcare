## The Story

Our story starts with stigmatization, there was is 5yrs old boy who could not keep up with his class always trailing behind. He was always branded as “FOOL”. The family who did not understand why he could not retain information for a long time decided to seek for help, it was there that the child was diagnosed with ADHD (Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder). The community started shying away from the family because the have a child with a mental disorder, the mere fact a child need to visit a psychiatric hospital just add salt to the injury. The stigmatization was not only from the community but visited the child in school. The only way the family saw out, was to mobilise resources and send this child out of the country to enable him get the best care need for him to survive in this world. Today he is a Mechanical Engineer. This child is my Nephew.
So the question is what happens to those who can't afford leaving the country? Or those who have made the bravest decision of getting help but can't face the stigma?
What next…………………… SELFCARE is the solution. 


At first, Sylfcare was envisioned as much different to what it is now.
It started as an idea for people to join group therapy, have video therapy sessions right from their comfort zone without anyone seeing them or stigmatizing them. A safe heaven platform where all your fears and worries can easily be meet, improving your overall Mental Health. However this idea was quickly changed because of the level difficulty it was for us as beginners and the limited time frame to submit our portfolio.
So faced with road blocks, we actually thought about what would be still a useful product. 
So brainstorming led to the insight that we could start by letting people know it was that easy to speak to a professional therapist or psychologist with the whole "neighbourhood not finding out" - some form of easy access to daily mental health care.
Sylfcare attempts to increase the awareness of mental health care and making it accessible - for people to actually seek the help they need without worring about the stigmatization involved.

That is why we are called Sylfcare!
